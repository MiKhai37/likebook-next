# LikeBook

The goal of this project is to make a copy of the core features of FaceBook:
- Users
- Profiles
- Posts
- Liking
- Friend Requests
- News feed/Timeline

## Techs Stack

To achieve this project, I'll use:
- The MERN Stack (MongoDB: database, Express: back-end, React: front-end, NodeJS: front-end)
- The NextJS Framework

This project focuses on the back end.
